Eikosograms: the picture of probability

- Online documentation is available
  [here](https://rwoldford.github.io/eikosograms/)

An eikosogram \[eye-*KOSS*-oh-gram\] (ancient Greek for probability
picture) divides the unit square into rectangular regions whose areas,
sides, and widths, represent various probabilities associated with the
values of one or more categorical variates.

Rectangle areas are joint probabilities, widths are **always** marginal
(though possibly joint margins, i.e. marginal joint distributions of two
or more variates), and heights of rectangles are **always** conditional
probabilities.

Eikosograms embed the **rules of probability** and are useful for
introducing probability theory, including axioms, marginal, conditional,
and joint probabilities, and their relationships (including **Bayes
theorem** as a completely trivial consequence).

They are markedly superior to Venn diagrams for this purpose, especially
in distinguishing probabilistic independence, mutually exclusive events,
coincident events, and associations. They also are useful for
identifying and understanding **conditional independence structure**.

As **data analysis** tools, eikosograms display categorical data in a
manner similar to Mosaic plots, especially when only two variates are
involved (the only case in which they are essentially identical, though
eikosograms purposely disallow spacing between rectangles). Unlike
Mosaic plots, **eikosograms do not alternate axes** as each new
categorical variate (beyond two) is introduced.

Instead, only one categorical variate, designated the “response”,
presents on the vertical axis and all others, designated the
“conditioning” variates, appear on the horizontal. In this way,
conditional probability appears only as height and marginal
probabilities as widths. The eikosogram is therefore much better suited
to a response model analysis (e.g. logistic model) than is a Mosaic
plot.

Mosaic plots are better suited to log-linear style modelling as in
discrete multivariate analysis.

Of course, eikosograms are also suited to discrete multivariate analysis
with each variate in turn appearing as the response. This makes it
better suited than Mosaic plots to discrete graphical models based on
conditional independence graphs (i.e. “Bayesian Networks” or
“BayesNets”).
