## Details

These are historical data taken from page 449 of Cohen and Nagel's 1934
"Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method". For this reason, the
original names of the racial groups have been retained.

The data are of special historical interest in Statistics because they
are one of the earliest recorded instances of a real Simpson's paradox
(Simpson 1951) occurring in practice (see Blyth 1971). Preserving this
historical context, the questions posed by Cohen and Nagel (1934) are
also recorded here using their own words. The data and questions appear
at the back of their book as exercises on "Chapter XVI: Statistical
Methods".

In their table, Cohen and Nagel (1934, p. 449) include the "death rates
from tuberculosis in Richmond, Virginia, and in New York City in 1910".
These rates (in number per 100,000) are easily calculated and so have
been excluded from the table given here.

In their words, Cohen and Nagel (1934, p. 449) pose the following two
questions as exercise (\*emphasis\* is theirs):

"a. Does it follow that tuberculosis caused a greater mortality in
Richmond than in New York?

b\. Notice that the death rate for whites and that for Negroes were
\*lower\* in Richmond than in New York, although the \*total\* death
rate was \*higher\*. Are the two populations compared really
\*comparable\*, that is, homogeneous?"
